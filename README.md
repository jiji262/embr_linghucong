# About embr

Embr is a blog engine / tumblelog built using the CodeIgniter framework designed to be lightweight and fast. Currently embr supports text and image posts, provides a simple CMS, Disquss commenting, infinite-scrolling, keyboard navigation, Facebook opengraph tags and finally is in the final stages of allowing custom themes and "reblogging" of posts. Installation is designed to be as simple as possible; a standard LAMP setup should do just fine.
